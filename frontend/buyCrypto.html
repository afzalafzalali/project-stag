            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. 
                Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Popular examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin. Cryptocurrencies enable secure, transparent, and borderless financial transactions.
